# Homework 1

*Make sure that you have [registered on the moodle
page](https://kurser.math.su.se/mod/feedback/view.php?id=93942) for this course.
If you have not done so, we will not be able to grade your assignment*

## Overview


In this assignment you will initialize a Github repository on your Github
account where you will put all future assignments and projects in. 

All future homework will be reported in `Markdown`, which is a simple
markup language. It will make it easy for you to write and present work on
Github since Github has a builtin Markdown parser.

If you are stuck, GOOGLE it! There is plenty of information on the web.

The instructions to solve this assignment is contained in [week
1](/lectures/week-1) of the course material.

To summarise:

- Initialize Github repo
- Create a simple report for the homework
- Peer review of a classmates homework

## Assigment

### Connecting to the Github repository

1. Create a Github repository under your account: Open the Github Desktop
   application. Create a new repository and name it `su-mt4007`. Save it
   somewhere easily accessible on your computer.

2. Now use the terminal and locate your repository that you have created. Start
   jupyter lab using the command `jupyter lab`. A tab in your browser will
   pop-up. Jupyter lab is now runnung! It should look something like this:

   ![Jupyter Lab](/img/jupyter_lab.png "Jupyter Lab")

3. Create a new folder (the button **next to** the big blue + button) and name
   it `HW1`. You can enter your newly created folder by double clicking on it.
   Inside the `HW1` subfolder, create a new notebook file using the blue +
   button and choosing a notebook. Name it `HW1`. It should look something like
   this:

   ![Jupyter Lab New Notebook](/img/jupyter_lab_new_notebook.png "Jupyter Lab New Notebook")


4. To the right of the image we see the notebook file. Consisting of an empty
   `cell`. The blue bar to the left of the cell indicates that the cell is
   highlighted. On the top of the notebook we see a toolbar. On the tool bar we
   can see what type the cell is. In the image above we see that it is a `Code`
   cell. For this exercise we want to change it to a `Markdown` cell. You can do
   this by clicking on the cell and then choosing `Markdown` from the toolbar.
   You are now able to write markdown in the cell. Write the follwing:

  - A title: Homework 1 using the appropriate markdown syntax. You can find it
    online.
  - A brief description of yourself. 
  - A brief description of your previous experience with Data Science.

4. Now, on the Github Desktop app you can **Commit** and then **Push** your
   changes to your Github repository. You can find information
   [here](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/overview/creating-your-first-repository-using-github-desktop)
   about how to do that. You will be able to see the changes you have made on
   your repository on [Github](https://Github.com).

5. When you are happy with the result, possibly after repeated uses of Commit
   and Push, go to your github repository on the web and open an issue in your
   repository (see image below where to find issues) stating “HW1 ready for
   grading!”.

### Peer Review

After deadline has passed, go to the repository of your assigned partner(You
will be assigned someone to peer-review) and give feedback under the issue they
have raised. You should provide feedback by responding to the “HW1 ready for
grading!” issue. Copy the following checklist and use it in your review:

* Is the homework complete, e.g. are all steps in the homework done?
