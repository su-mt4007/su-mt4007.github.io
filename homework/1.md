# Homework 1 — GitHub Setup & First Report

> **Prerequisite**
> Make sure you have **registered on Moodle** for this course. If you are not registered, we cannot grade your work.

## Overview

In HW1 you will:

* Use your pre-created GitHub repository **`username-hw-1`**.
* Add a short, readable **report** (Markdown `README.md` or Jupyter notebook).
* Commit any **code and data instructions** needed to reproduce your output.
* Submit via a **GitHub Issue**.
* Complete one **peer review**.

This establishes the workflow used for all later homeworks.

## Learning Goals

* Get comfortable with the course GitHub submission workflow.
* Write a clear, concise, markdown-style report.
* Make results **reproducible** (code + instructions).
* Practice constructive peer review.

## Tasks

1. **Prepare the repository**

   * Accept access to your repo **`username-hw-1`**.
   * Clone it locally.
   * Create a minimal structure:

     ```
     username-hw-1/
     ├─ HW1/
     │  ├─ README.md  (or HW1.ipynb)
     │  ├─ src/       (your code, if any)
     │  └─ data/      (optional; or instructions to obtain data)
     ├─ environment/  (optional: env files, e.g. requirements.txt or environment.yml)
     └─ README.md     (optional repo-level notes)
     ```

2. **Write the report (Markdown or Notebook)**
   Include, at minimum:

   * **Title:** “Homework 1”
   * **About you (2–4 sentences):** academic/programme context only (no personal contact details).
   * **Prior experience with data science (3–6 sentences):** tools/languages you’ve used, courses, interests.
   * **One simple figure or table** (optional): e.g., a tiny demo using any dataset (can be built-in, e.g., `seaborn.load_dataset("tips")`), purely to test your toolchain.
   * **Reproducibility note:** brief instructions to run your code (e.g., “`pip install -r requirements.txt` then open `HW1/HW1.ipynb`”).

3. **Make it reproducible**

   * Commit the **code** that produces your outputs (plots/tables).
   * If you use any data, include **download instructions or a small sample**; do not commit large files.
   * Provide minimal **environment instructions** (requirements file or a short note).

4. **Submit**

   * Push your work.
   * Open an Issue in the repo titled **`HW1 – Submission`**.
     *(Optional)* add the label **`ready-for-grading`**.
   * In the Issue body, include:

     * A link to your report file.
     * A 2–3 line summary of what’s included.
     * Any notes for the grader (e.g., where to find code).

## Allowed Tools

Use **any tools you like** (Python/R/SQL/editors). The only requirements are:

* The report is **readable on GitHub** (`README.md` or `.ipynb`).
* All code used to generate outputs is included so results are **reproducible**.

## Peer Review (after the deadline)

Review your assigned partner’s repository and comment under **their** `HW1 – Submission` Issue.

**Checklist (copy into your comment):**

* **Coverage:** Are all HW1 tasks present? (repo structure, report, submission issue)
* **Reproducibility:** Is it clear how to run the code and reproduce outputs?
* **Clarity:** Is the report concise and readable on GitHub?
* **One highlight:** Something done especially well.
* **One suggestion:** A specific, actionable improvement.

## Grading

Per-homework grading: **U (Fail) / G (Pass) / VG (Pass with Distinction)** based on:

* **Completeness:** Required items present (repo, report, code, submission issue).
* **Clarity:** Report is readable, well-structured, concise.
* **Correctness/Reproducibility:** Code runs or is clearly explained; outputs are reproducible with provided notes.

**Notes**

* Late submissions require an **extra task** and are graded **Pass/Fail** only (no VG).
* Keep personal information minimal and professional.

## Submission Summary (quick reference)

* Repo: **`username-hw-1`**
* Report: **`HW1/README.md`** *or* **`HW1/HW1.ipynb`**
* Issue: **`HW1 – Submission`** (link to report; optional label `ready-for-grading`)
* Deadline: **Tuesday 23:59 (Europe/Stockholm)**
