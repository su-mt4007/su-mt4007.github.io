# Homework 3 — Exploring & Visualising Data

## Overview

In HW3 you will:

* Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on three datasets.
* Produce clear **tables/plots** and concise interpretations.
* Practice **data cleaning** (types, missing values, normalisation).
* Deliver a **reproducible** report.

**Tools:** Use anything you like (Python/R/SQL/editors). Your report must be readable on GitHub (**`README.md` or `.ipynb`**). Commit all code needed to reproduce outputs.

**Data repo:** `https://github.com/su-mt4007/data`
Files used here: `IRIS.csv`, `artportalen.csv`, `stroke-data.csv`, `cell_phones_total.csv`.


## Report Requirements (markdown or notebook)

Keep it short and scannable:

* **Title & brief intro** (datasets + goals)
* **Sections per task** with headings
* **Methods** (a few sentences + code)
* **Tables/figures** with captions and readable labels
* **Notes on parsing/cleaning** (e.g., separators, decimals, type fixes)
* **How to run** (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt` → open notebook)

Avoid committing large raw data; give download instructions instead.

## A. Exploratory Data Analysis

### A1) IRIS

File: `IRIS.csv` (three species; sepal/petal lengths & widths)

1. **Sepal vs Petal (scatter grid)**
   Recreate a figure equivalent to the example (one panel per pair or a 2×2 grid is fine).

   * Show relationships between **sepal** and **petal** dimensions, colour/shape by **species**.
   * Briefly state what the figure shows (2–4 sentences).

2. **Distributions (box/violin/histograms)**
   Recreate the distribution figure style shown (boxplots are fine).

   * Compare distributions of sepal/petal features across species.
   * One or two concise conclusions.

3. **Pairs plot**
   Produce a **pairs plot** (scatter matrix) with species colouring.

   * Note 2–3 relationships (e.g., strongest separations, near-linear pairs).

> Acceptance (IRIS): correct file load, labelled axes/legends, three concise interpretations total (one per sub-task).


### A2) Birdwatching (Artportalen 2022, Royal National Park)

File: `artportalen.csv` (bird sightings; citizen-science)

1. **Familiarise & describe**

   * Show the first rows + a short data dictionary (your inferred meaning of key columns).

2. **Most prevalent species**

   * Define **prevalent** (e.g., most observations, unique days with sightings, or unique locations). State your choice.
   * Report the **top N** (N≥5) in a tidy table.

3. **Monthly distribution (top 3)**

   * For your **top 3** species, show a monthly time series or bar chart (one figure or small multiples).
   * One sentence per species describing the pattern.

4. **Rarest species**

   * Define **rarest** (consistent with your prevalence definition); show a small table (e.g., 5–10 entries).
   * Brief note on potential **reporting bias** (citizen science).

5. **Your own questions (≥3)**

   * Pose **three** non-trivial questions and answer them with brief text + a supporting table/plot each.
   * Each question should surface a distinct property of the data (seasonality, spatiality, observer effects, etc.).

> Acceptance (Birdwatching): explicit prevalence/rarity definitions, at least one figure for monthly patterns, three self-posed Q&As with evidence.


### A3) Predicting Strokes (EDA only)

File: `stroke-data.csv` (individual attributes + stroke outcome)

* Produce **one to three** well-labelled plots that explore relationships between selected features and the **stroke** outcome.
* For at least **one** categorical feature, compare **stroke rates** across groups (e.g., bar with percentages).
* For at least **one** numeric feature, compare distributions by outcome (e.g., KDE/box/ECDF).
* Write **clear, non-causal** conclusions (descriptive, not predictive; note potential confounders and class imbalance).

> Acceptance (Strokes): ≥2 plots (categorical + numeric), group rates correctly computed, 2–4 sentences of careful interpretation.


## B. Data Preparation

### B1) Cleaning `cell_phones_total.csv`

Dataset: total mobile phones per country (1960–2019). Values may be strings with suffixes **k=1e3**, **M=1e6**, **B=1e9**, mixed decimal signs, and missing values.

**Tasks**

1. **Type normalisation:** Convert all **relevant** value cells to numeric.

   * Parse suffixes `k/M/B` robustly (case-insensitive).
   * Handle decimal marks (`.` or `,`) consistently.

2. **Missing values:** Treat missing data appropriately.

   * Choose sensible imputation or leave as `NaN` if justified—explain briefly.
   * You do **not** need to treat all years/countries identically.

3. **Tidy output table:** Produce a wide table with columns: `iso-3`, `2015`, `2016`, `2017`, `2018`, `2019`.

   * All **parsing** is done; values are numeric or `NaN`.
   * Sort by the **2015** column descending (ties arbitrary).
   * Show the first ~10 rows in the report.

> Acceptance (Cleaning): demonstrated parsing of suffixes + decimals, documented missing-value choice, correctly typed final table.


## Acceptance Criteria (overall)

* **Clarity:** Report is organised with headings; figures/tables have titles, axes, legends.
* **Correctness:** Code reads files correctly (separators/decimals), computations match definitions you stated.
* **Completeness:** All A1–A3 and B1 deliverables present.
* **Reproducibility:** Code and minimal environment notes included; random seeds set where relevant.


## Submission

1. Push your work to **`username-homework-3`**.
2. Open an Issue titled **`HW3 – Submission`** (optional label: `ready-for-grading`).
   Include:

   * Link to your report (`HW3/README.md` **or** `HW3/HW3.ipynb`)
   * 2–3 lines summarising results (one per dataset is fine)
   * Notes on any parsing/cleaning decisions

**Assignment deadline:** **Tuesday 23:59 (Europe/Stockholm)**

## Peer Review (after the deadline)

Comment under your partner’s **`HW3 – Submission`** Issue. Copy this checklist:

* **Coverage:** Are all required tasks (A1–A3, B1) completed?
* **Definitions:** Are prevalence/rarity and cleaning choices stated and applied consistently?
* **Figures/tables:** Labels, readability, and match to claims?
* **Reproducibility:** Can you see how to run the code and reproduce outputs?
* **One highlight & one suggestion:** Specific and actionable.

**Peer-review deadline:** **Thursday 23:59 (Europe/Stockholm)**

## Grading

Per-homework scale **U / G / VG** based on:

* **Completeness** (all tasks + submission + peer review)
* **Clarity** (well-structured report; concise, precise writing)
* **Correctness & Reproducibility** (parsing/cleaning done properly; code produces shown outputs)

**Notes**

* Late submissions/reviews require an **extra task** and are graded **Pass/Fail** only (no VG).
* Keep claims **descriptive**, not causal; cite any external sources or code you adapt.
