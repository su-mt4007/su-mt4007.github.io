# Homework 5

## Instructions

In this assigment, you will practice your skills in both SQL and Regex. The
scenario involves user activity logs and user comments. The goal is to perform
data analysis tasks using SQL queries and extract relevant information from user
comments using Regex.

Make sure of the following:
- Your solutions should be in form of a report in .md format.
- You have documented your procedure properly. 
- Your answers are clear and concise.

When you are finished push you results to Github and **raise an issue**, just as you
have done in previous homeworks. To pass the homework you will have to complete
the assigments below and also finish the [peer-review](/homework/#peer-review).

Feel free to contact me if anything is unclear.
