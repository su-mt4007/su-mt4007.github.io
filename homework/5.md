# Homework 5 — Data from the Web (REST & Scraping)

## Overview

In HW5 you will:

* Fetch JSON from a public **REST API** (Nobel Prize).
* Parse nested JSON and build a **word-cloud** from prize **motivations**.
* **Scrape** a small website (Books to Scrape) across multiple pages and assemble a tidy table.

**Tools:** Use anything you like (Python/R/etc.). Your report must be readable on GitHub (**`README.md` or `.ipynb`**). Commit all code needed to reproduce results.

## Report Requirements (Markdown or Notebook)

Keep it concise and reproducible:

* **Title & brief intro** (what you fetched/scraped and why)
* **Sections:** REST API → Web Scraping
* Short **methods** with code blocks/cells
* **Figures/tables** with captions and clear labels
* **Reproducibility notes** (how to run; environment/requirements; where raw data is saved)

Avoid committing large binary files; you may cache raw JSON/HTML as small text files.

## Part A — REST API (Nobel Prize)

**Goal:** Fetch **Physics** prize data via the **Nobel Prize API (v2.x)**, extract all **motivations**, and visualise word frequencies with a **word cloud**.

### A1) Fetch JSON

* Query the Nobel API for **Nobel Prizes in Physics** (all available years).
* Handle **pagination** if present (iterate until all pages are retrieved).
* Save the raw response(s) to disk (e.g., `data/nobel_physics.json`) for reproducibility.

> Tip: When APIs return a top-level object with lists, capture the list that contains individual prizes/entries. Record any query parameters you used (category, year range, limit, offset, etc.).

### A2) Parse & extract motivations

* From the JSON, extract **every motivation string** associated with the Physics prizes (include all laureates’ motivations).
* Clean text (lowercase, strip punctuation/whitespace, remove **stopwords**; consider stemming/lemmatisation optional).
* Keep a short list of **domain stopwords** (e.g., “nobel”, “prize”, “physics”, “prizes”, “laureate”, “motivation”) so the cloud isn’t dominated by boilerplate.

### A3) Word cloud

* Generate and display a **word cloud** from the cleaned motivations.
* Include the **top 20 terms** with counts in a small table next to or below the cloud.
* Briefly interpret (2–4 sentences): What themes recur? Any surprises?

**Acceptance (Part A)**

* API call(s) shown with parameters; pagination handled if needed.
* Motivations extracted for all Physics entries; cleaning steps stated.
* Word cloud + top-terms table included, with a short interpretation.
* Raw JSON cached locally and referenced in the report.

## Part B — Web Scraping (Books to Scrape)

**Site:** [https://books.toscrape.com/](https://books.toscrape.com/)
**Scope:** **First three catalogue pages** (page 1–3) → **20 books per page** → **60 rows** total.

**Target table (exact columns):**

```
upc | title | price | rating
```

**Definitions**

* **upc:** Product page UPC string.
* **title:** Book title.
* **price:** Price string as shown (e.g., “£51.77”).
* **rating:** Star rating as a word (e.g., “One”, “Two”, … “Five”).

### B1) Strategy

* Start from the catalogue page 1 and follow pagination to pages 2 and 3.
* For each book, follow the link to its **detail page** to extract **UPC** (and confirm price/rating if needed).
* Assemble a single **DataFrame/table** with exactly 60 rows and the four columns above.

### B2) Robustness & etiquette

* Set a custom **User-Agent** header.
* Add a small **delay** between requests (e.g., 0.5–1.0s).
* Handle **unexpected HTML** gracefully (missing fields → skip or record `NA` with a note).
* If the site uses relative links, resolve to absolute URLs safely.

### B3) Deliverable

* Show the **first 5 rows** as a preview and the overall **row count** (should be 60).
* Save the final table to `data/books_page1-3.csv` (or similar).

**Acceptance (Part B)**

* Exactly **60** rows with the specified columns and non-empty UPCs.
* Clear method (pagination, per-book detail fetch, delays).
* Clean, readable code; a brief note on any anomalies encountered.

## Submission

1. Push your work to **`username-homework-5`**.
2. Open an Issue titled **`HW5 – Submission`** (optional label: `ready-for-grading`).
   Include:

   * Link to your report (`HW5/README.md` **or** `HW5/HW5.ipynb`).
   * 2–4 lines summarising results (API + cloud; scraper table size).
   * Any notes on rate limiting, pagination, or HTML quirks.

**Assignment deadline:** **Tuesday 23:59 (Europe/Stockholm)**

## Peer Review (after the deadline)

Comment under your partner’s **`HW5 – Submission`** Issue. Copy this checklist:

* **Coverage:** API fetch + motivations + word cloud; scraper with 60 rows and required columns
* **Reproducibility:** Raw JSON cached; scraper code deterministic with delays; environment notes included
* **Clarity:** Report structure, labelled figure/table, concise explanations
* **Correctness:** All Physics motivations included; UPC/price/rating correctly captured
* **One highlight & one suggestion:** Specific and actionable

**Peer-review deadline:** **Thursday 23:59 (Europe/Stockholm)**

## Grading

Per-homework scale **U / G / VG** based on:

* **Completeness** (all tasks + submission + peer review)
* **Clarity** (clean structure; readable outputs; brief, precise writing)
* **Correctness & Reproducibility** (API handling, parsing/cleaning, scraper reliability; code runs or is clearly explained)

**Notes**

* Late submissions/reviews require an **extra task** and are graded **Pass/Fail** only (no VG).
* **Ethics:** Scrape politely (headers, delays) and stay within the stated page scope.
* **Citations:** If you adapt code (e.g., for word clouds), cite your source briefly in the report.
