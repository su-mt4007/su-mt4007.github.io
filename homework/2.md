# Homework 2 — Tables & Plots (Basics)

## Overview

In HW2 you’ll practice:

* Reading CSV files with varying **separators/delimiters/decimal signs**
* Basic **table operations** (select, derive columns, sort, group, summarise)
* Producing a **simple, readable plot** that supports a conclusion
* Writing a clear, reproducible **report** (Markdown or Notebook)

You may use **any tools** (Python/R/SQL/editors). Your report must be **readable on GitHub** (`README.md` or `.ipynb`), and **all code** producing tables/figures must be committed so results are reproducible.

## Repo Setup

Use your per-homework repo **`username-homework-2`** 

```
HW2/
  README.md            # or HW2.ipynb
  src/                 # scripts or functions you call from the report
  data/                # small data or instructions to fetch large data
  requirements.txt     # or environment.yml / renv.lock (optional but helpful)
.gitignore             # ignore caches, OS files, large raw data, notebooks’ checkpoints
```

Create a top-level **`.gitignore`** and exclude unnecessary files (e.g., `*.DS_Store`, `.ipynb_checkpoints/`, large raw files, virtual envs).

## Data

All datasets are in the course data repo:
**[https://github.com/su-mt4007/data](https://github.com/su-mt4007/data)**

* `Booli_sold.csv` — apartment sales in **Ekhagen**
* `2018_R_per_kommun.csv` — **Swedish 2018 election** results by municipality
* `stroke-data.csv` — **stroke** outcomes with individual attributes (source: Kaggle)

> Tip: CSVs may use different **separators** (`,` `;` `\t`) and **decimal signs** (`.` `,`). In pandas, for example:
> `pd.read_csv(path, sep=';', decimal=',')`. In R: `read.csv(..., sep=';', dec=',')`.


## Tasks

### A) Apartment Prices (Ekhagen)

Using `Booli_sold.csv`:

1. **Price per sqm (ppsqm):** Add a derived column `ppsqm = price / living_area` (use the dataset’s column names as appropriate; handle missing/zero areas).
2. **Top 5 by ppsqm:** Show a table of the **five** most expensive apartments by `ppsqm` (columns: id/address, size, price, `ppsqm`).
3. **Average ppsqm:** Compute and report the **mean** `ppsqm` (state how you handled missing values/outliers).
4. **One insight:** Briefly highlight **one** interesting aspect/pattern (2–4 sentences) and show a small supporting table or plot.

### B) Swedish Election 2018

Using `2018_R_per_kommun.csv`:

1. **Legitimate votes in Stockholm:** Compute the **total number of legitimate votes** (*Giltiga Röster*) across all **Stockholm** municipalities (explain how you filtered Stockholm).
2. **Highest S%:** Identify the **municipality** with the highest vote **percentage for Socialdemokraterna (S)**. Report municipality name and percentage.
3. **Participation ranking:** Produce a table of the **top 3 municipalities by participation (Valdeltagande)** with municipality name and participation rate.

> Be explicit about how you parsed the file (separator/decimal), and include any renaming you did so your code is easy to follow.

### C) Predicting Strokes (one simple plot)

Using `stroke-data.csv`:

* Create **one** simple, well-labeled plot that supports a **single, clear conclusion** (e.g., relationship between a binary/categorical feature and stroke outcome, or a summary of rates across groups).
* State your **conclusion in one or two sentences**, referring to the plot (avoid causal claims; stick to descriptive insight).

## Report Requirements (Markdown or Notebook)

Your report should be concise and easy to follow on GitHub:

* **Title & brief intro** (what you did, data files used)
* **Methods/steps** with short prose and code cells/blocks
* **Tables/figures** placed near the text that discusses them
* **Reproducibility notes**: how to run (e.g., `pip install -r requirements.txt` then open the notebook)
* **Conclusion** (1–3 bullets or sentences)

Keep large data out of Git; provide **download instructions** if needed.

## Acceptance Criteria (what we look for)

* **Reads the data correctly** (handles separator/decimal, shows code)
* **Derives `ppsqm`**, shows **Top-5 table**, computes **average ppsqm**, and states **one insight**
* **Election tasks completed** (Stockholm total legitimate votes; municipality with highest S%; top-3 participation table)
* **One stroke plot** + **one-sentence conclusion**
* **Reproducibility**: code and minimal environment notes included
* **Clarity**: report is readable on GitHub with headings/markdown

## Submission

1. Push your work to GitHub.
2. Open an Issue titled **`HW2 – Submission`** (optional label: `ready-for-grading`).
   In the Issue body, include:

   * Link to your report file (`HW2/README.md` or `HW2/HW2.ipynb`)
   * 2–3 lines summarising your results
   * Any notes for the grader (e.g., parsing choices)

**Deadline:** Tuesday 23:59 (Europe/Stockholm)

## Peer Review (after the deadline)

Comment under **your partner’s** `HW2 – Submission` Issue. Copy this checklist:

* **Coverage:** Are all HW2 tasks completed?
* **Parsing:** Is the separator/decimal handling explicit and correct?
* **Results:** Do Top-5, averages, and rankings look consistent with the code?
* **Clarity:** Is the report organised and readable on GitHub?
* **Reproducibility:** Can you reproduce (or see how to reproduce) the outputs?
* **One suggestion:** A specific, actionable improvement.

**Peer-review deadline:** Thursday 23:59 (Europe/Stockholm)

## Grading

Per-homework scale **U / G / VG** based on:

* **Completeness** (all tasks + submission/peer review)
* **Clarity** (well-structured, labelled tables/plots, brief explanations)
* **Correctness & Reproducibility** (parsing handled; code produces shown outputs)

**Notes**

* Late submissions or reviews require an **extra task** and are graded **Pass/Fail** only (no VG).
