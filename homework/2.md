# Homework 2

## Instructions

Your solutions should be in form of a report in notebook (`.ipynb`) format, with
a report that is easy to follow and understand, remember that Github has a
builtin notebook interpreter. Make sure to document you procedure and segment
the report properly. Make use of the markdown syntax to do this!

When you are finished push you results to Github and raise an issue, just as you
have done in previous homework. To pass the homework you will have to complete
the assigments below and also finish the peer-review.

Feel free to contact me if anything is unclear.

## Setting up the repo 

From [homework 1](/homework/1) you should already have your repository set up. To
begin with, create a `.gitignore` file in the root of you repository. Make sure that
you ignore files that are unnecessary to the homework. Now, create a new folder, name it
something along the lines of `homework_2` or `hw2`. Remember to use `_` instead of spaces between words.

**After you are finished with the homework, make sure to push changes to your
github.** 

## Working with tables
