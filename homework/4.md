# Homework 4

## Instructions

Make sure of the following:
- Your solutions should be in form of a report in .md or .ipynb format.
- You have documented your procedure properly. 
- Your answers are clear and concise.

When you are finished push you results to Github and **raise an issue**, just as you
have done in previous homeworks. To pass the homework you will have to complete
the assigments below and also finish the [peer-review](/homework/#peer-review).

Feel free to contact me if anything is unclear.


## Joining Data 

Use the cleaned data from the previous homework!

Now that we have cleaned our cell phones data, we want to analyse the number of
cell phones per capita. To make this possible, we need to expand our original dataset.
The file `pop_data.csv` contains data about the population size of countries
over years. Once again there will be missing values. Deal with them before
proceeding. 

To combine the cell phone data with the population data, we need to reshape both
datasets. This can be done by pivotting the tables into the right format.
Remember the *3* rules from [week 3](/lectures/week-3). Present a similar table
to below the one below.

| iso-3   |   year |   n_cellphones |      population |
|:--------|-------:|---------------:|----------------:|
| ABW     |   1960 |              0 | 54608           |
| AFG     |   1960 |              0 |     8.62247e+06 |
| AGO     |   1960 |              0 |     5.3572e+06  |
| ALB     |   1960 |              0 |     1.6088e+06  |
| AND     |   1960 |              0 |  9443           |

The iso-3 format is nice to work with but for presentation it is better to work
with real names of the countries. A mapping between iso-3 and country name can
be found in the `country_data.csv` file.

Combine the cell phone, population and country data into a single table.
Calcualte the number of phones per capita. I.e
`n_cellphones`/`population_size`. Present
a similar table to below. Here, the coutries are the ones with highest number of
cell phones per capita in 2019. 

|   year |   Macao |   Hong Kong |   United Arab Emirates |   Antigua and Barbuda |   Seychelles |
|-------:|--------:|------------:|-----------------------:|----------------------:|-------------:|
|   2015 | 3.08823 |     2.2904  |                2.00742 |               1.95684 |      1.58426 |
|   2016 | 3.14351 |     2.39893 |                2.21252 |               1.98754 |      1.60546 |
|   2017 | 3.2101  |     2.48877 |                2.18343 |               2.01934 |      1.74243 |
|   2018 | 3.34874 |     2.67021 |                2.19908 |               2.00816 |      1.8499  |
|   2019 | 3.28485 |     2.86365 |                2.12774 |               1.99746 |      1.9872  |

**Note that you might get a slightly different table based on how you deal with
missing data. This is okay! make sure to document your procedure.**

Analyse the country with highest growth rate of cell phones (per capita) in the last 10 years. That is,
create a plot that illustrates the growth rate of the countries in the table
above over the last 10 years.

*Hint: You can pivot the tables to get the desired output.*

## SQL

The file `user_actions.db` in the data repo contains an SQLite database. In the database there is a table
named `user_actions`. Analyse the table and solve the following tasks.

- Retrieve the usernames of all users who have performed the "signup" action.
- Find the total number of log entries for each user. Display the user_id,
  username, and the count of log entries.
- Identify users who have both logged in (action = 'login') and signed up
  (action = 'signup') on the same day. Display the user_id and username.

Each task should be solved **only** using SQL. 

## Regex

The file `comments.txt` in the data repo contains lines of text, each
representing a user comment. Users sometimes include tags in their comments
using the format "#tag". Analyse the file and solve the following tasks.

- Write a regular expression to extract all hashtags from a given comment. For
  example, applying the regex to comment 1 should return ["#programming",
  "#tips"].
- Create a regular expression to find comments that mention both "#programming"
  and "#python". Apply the regex to comment 2 and check if it matches.
- Using your regular expression, extract all unique hashtags from the entire
  text file. (*)

The last task is optional (*)! 

Each task should be solved **only** using regex.

Good Luck!
