# Homework

The homework component has **6 assignments**, each paired with a **peer review** of a classmate’s work.
To **pass**, you must submit **every assignment** and complete **its peer review** by the stated deadlines.

**Deadlines are strict.** Missing either the assignment or the peer-review
deadline requires an **extra task** to earn credit for that homework (see Moodle
for details).

Each homework aligns with the weekly material (e.g., **HW1 ↔ Week 1**, **HW2 ↔ Week 2**, …).

## At a Glance

* **Workload:** 6 assignments + 6 peer reviews
* **Deadlines per homework:** Assignment **Tue 23:59**, Peer Review **Thu 23:59** (Europe/Stockholm)
* **Pass rule (per homework):** Submit **both** the assignment and its peer review by the deadlines.

  * If you miss a deadline, you must complete an **extra task** (assigned at the end of the course).
  * **Late work cannot earn VG**; late items are graded **Pass/Fail** only.
* **Grading scale (per homework):** **U (Fail) / G (Pass) / VG (Pass with Distinction)**, based on **completeness, clarity, correctness**.
* **Final grade for HW module:** Determined by the six homework grades:

  * **VG (Pass with Distinction):** ≥ **4** assignments graded **VG** (the rest at least **G**)
  * **G (Pass):** **All 6** assignments graded **G** or higher
  * **U (Fail):** Fewer than **6** assignments graded **G**

## How Assignments Work

Each assignment contains a few tasks covering material from previous week(s).
**Submit a short, blog-style report** with explanations and a clear workflow—**not** a bullet-point list of answers.

### Submission Flow

1. Push your work to **your homework GitHub repository** (e.g., `homework-1`). Include a short, readable **report** (notebook or markdown) in the repo.
2. **Open an issue** in that repo titled **`HW# – Submission`** (e.g., `HW1 – Submission`).
   *We only grade assignments with this issue.*
   *(If you use labels, add `ready-for-grading`.)*

### After Grading

* You may **fix mistakes** identified by the grader. Commit your changes.
* Add a **comment under the closed submission issue** describing what you changed.
* We’ll re-check and update your grade if applicable.

## Peer Review

You’ll be assigned a partner (announced in class or on Moodle). Read their report and code, then leave constructive feedback under **their submission issue**.

Address at least:

* **Coverage:** Has the student completed all required tasks?
* **Highlights:** What’s especially clear, effective, or well done?
* **Clarity issues:** What’s confusing or could be improved?

**Peer-review deadline:** **Thursdays 23:59 (Europe/Stockholm)** for the corresponding homework.

## Notes & Reminders

* **Format:** A short, readable report (notebook or markdown) with clear explanations and a few well-chosen figures.
* **Reproducibility:** Your repo should run from a fresh clone (data access notes, environment instructions if needed).
* **Peer-review tone:** Be kind, specific, and actionable—aim to help your classmate improve.
* **Late work:** Late assignments or reviews require an **extra task** (details on Moodle).

## Academic Integrity & Tools

* You may use standard libraries and course-approved tools. If you consult external sources or AI assistants, **cite what you used and how**.
* All code and writing you submit must be **your own** and reflect your understanding.
