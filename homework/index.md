# Homework

The homework portion of this course consists of 6 assigments, each paired with
peer-review of a fellow students assignment. Both the assignment and the
peer-review have to be finished to pass the homework. The deadline for both the
assignments and peer-review are strict. If you do not manage to submit the
homework in time you will need to do an extra assignment based on the number of
late entries.

Each homework corresponds to a lecture, e.g Homework 1 corresponds to week 1 and
homework 2 to week 2 and so on.

## Assigment 

The assigment will consists of a few tasks that test you on the material we have
done in the previous weeks. Report the solutions to the assgiments in form of a
blogpost with clear explanations and documentation of the procedure, **not as
list of answers**.

The homework is submitted to your Github repository. When you are finished
*raise an issue*, otherwise we will not grade your assignment.

Once your work has been assessed by the grader, you will have the opportunity to
correct the misstakes you have made. You can do this by correcting the mistakes
and leaving a comment (under the closed issue) that you have fixed the misstakes.

## Peer Review

You will be assigned a partner in the course that you will peer-review. The
peer-review consists of analysing the fellow students solutions to the assigment.
Give feedback on the solutions and the report as a whole. Answers the following
questions:

- Has the person answered all the questions? 
- Is there something you really like about the report?
- Is anything unclear? 

You will give your feedback under the issue that has been raised. 

**The deadline for the peer-review is on Thursday at 23:59.**
