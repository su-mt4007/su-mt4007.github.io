# Course Information

## What this course is about

Data science is mostly about getting, cleaning, exploring, and **explaining** data—clearly and reproducibly. In this course you’ll learn to do exactly that with modern tools. We’ll write code, make plots, and (most importantly) make our work repeatable so that someone else—and future‑you—can run it and get the same results.

You can use **Python or R** throughout the course. Pick the one you’re most comfortable with (or want to learn); the ideas are the same.

## How the course runs

This is a self‑study‑first course. Each week you read/watch the materials, try
things, and work on a small assignment. Instead of traditional lectures, we meet
once a week for a **live demo** of last week’s material—think short walk‑through
+ tips + Q&A—followed by **drop‑in help** time. We also host **Thursday Zoom**
hours for questions.

* Exact days/times/links are on the relevant pages:
  **[Lectures](/lectures/)** • **[Homework](/homework/)** • **[Project](/project/)** • **[Exam](/exam/)**

## What you’ll be able to do

By the end, you will be able to:

* Use **Git/GitHub** for version control, collaborate with others, and review code.
* Build **reproducible** analyses in Python or R (clear README, tidy notebooks/scripts, and a workflow others can run).
* **Retrieve**, **transform**, **explore**, and **visualize** data with confidence.
* Communicate results in a way that’s honest, clear, and useful.

## How you’re assessed (short version)

You’ll practice every week, do an **individual project**, and finish with an **exam**.

* **Home assignments:** weekly, **Pass/Fail**. Focus on the data‑analysis pipeline: load → transform → explore → visualize → report. Expect roughly **half‑time study** each week. Details: **[Homework](/homework/)**.
* **Project:** **70%** of the final grade (A–F). Pick a public/open dataset and tell a clear, reproducible data story. Details, milestones, and rubric: **[Project](/project/)**.
* **Exam:** **30%** of the final grade (A–F). You’ll apply course methods to a given problem. Format and scheduling: **[Exam](/exam/)**.

Passing rules, exact deadlines, late/resubmission policies, and feedback timelines live on the relevant pages (and are listed on the relevant pages and on **Moodle**).

## Getting help

* **Live demo + drop‑in + Zoom:** weekly—see **[Lectures](/lectures/)** for times and rooms.
* **TAs & contacts:** see **Moodle** for the current TA list and how to reach us.

## A note on collaboration & AI tools

We encourage discussion and learning together, but there are clear rules about
what must be your own work. 

Any AI assistance (e.g., ChatGPT/Copilot) must be cited clearly. Flagrant
copy/paste or uncredited AI will be considered plagiarism.
