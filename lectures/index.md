# Lectures

There will be no formal lectures. The content is intended to be studied on your
own. However, every **Tuesday between 13.00-17.00** I will be present in the lecture
hall to give a live demo of the material covered in the previous week followed
by time afterwards for answering questions and helping with the homework. In
previous itterations of the course, the live demos have been very appreciated.
In addition, I will be available on **Fridays between 13.00-16.00** via Zoom for
questions.

**Bring your laptops**. I will aim to make some parts of the lecture
interactive, and bringing your laptop and following along will make it easier
for you to complete the homework.

The information about the where the lecture will be can be found in the timeedit
schedule can be found
[here](https://cloud.timeedit.net/su/web/stud1/s.html?tab=3&object=cevt_48182_HT2023&startDate=20230930&endDate=20240413&type=courseevent&h=t&l=en).

You can find the code for the demos in the following [Github
repository](https://github.com/su-mt4007/lecture-demos)

The lectures demos are **not** mandatory, but highly recommended. You will have
direct access to me during the allotted lecture times. Use it!
