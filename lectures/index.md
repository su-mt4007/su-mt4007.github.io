# Lectures

There are no formal lectures; the material is designed for self-study. However, I’ll be available for live demos and Q&A each week:

* **Tuesdays, 13:00–17:00 (on campus):** Live demo of the previous week’s material, followed by time for questions and homework help. In past iterations of the course, these sessions have been very appreciated.
* **Fridays, 13:00–16:00 (on Zoom):** Open Q&A.

**Bring your laptop.** Parts of the sessions will be interactive, and following along will make the homework easier.

Room and location details are in the TimeEdit schedule:

The code for all demos is available here:

Attendance at the live demos is **not** mandatory, but highly recommended—you’ll have direct access to me during these times. Use it!
